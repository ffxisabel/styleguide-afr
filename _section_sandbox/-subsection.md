Tubby or Not Tubby. That is the question.

All components use multiples of our base “Tubby unit” of 16px, to align elements for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Our Iconography is also based on this system.

It is a good default font size, which is a factor of all screen resolutions (320, 768, 1024). It also provides a memorable system, with multiples greater (32, 64, …) and factors less than (8, 4, 2).

Tubby unit set of limited spatial options, based on 16.


A grounded spatial system range limits expectations on how it is used and avoids slipping into unpredictable steps, by offering too many choices.
