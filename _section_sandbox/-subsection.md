This is a subsection.

All components use multiples of our base “Tubby unit” of 16px, to align elements for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Our Iconography is also based on this system.

It is a good default font size, which is a factor of all screen resolutions (320, 768, 1024). It also provides a memorable system, with multiples greater (32, 64, …) and factors less than (8, 4, 2).
