For all the colours above, black or white text is being used with them according to which has sufficient contrast to comply with [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast).

In most cases, these colours will be used with black or white. However, our body text colour is Slate 500 and although most of our text sits against a white background there may be some instances in which we use a light grey background (Slate 100) instead (sponsored content spots are one of these). In these cases, a darker text colour, such as Slate 600, must be used instead.
